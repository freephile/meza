# Define all the Ansible community modules that we need for Meza to work
# 
# Install from the 'config' directory with
# ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
# or the full invocation would be
# ansible-galaxy collection install -vvv -r ../requirements.yml -p ../collections/
# You can leave off the 'collections path' argument since that is stipulated in config/ansible.cfg
#
# Newer versions of ansible-galaxy do not require the 'collection' keyword
collections:
    - 'community.general'
    - 'ansible.posix'
    - 'gluster.gluster'
    - 'community.mysql'
