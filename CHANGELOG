commit 86aea143c9546af22a3108cb6660658391915c93
Author: Greg Rundlett <greg.rundlett@gmail.com>
Commit: Greg Rundlett <greg.rundlett@gmail.com>

    Fix first-time deploy errors related to SMW rebuild data
    
    Add the special 'never' tag to the task in the MediaWiki role.
    With the 'never' tag, this task will ONLY be run if you specifically ask
    for it with the --tags=smw-data option (or --tags=never option).
    
    This changes behavior of Meza so that it does not rebuild SMW data
    on each and every deploy. To specifically request a SMW rebuild, simply
    ask for it by name with `sudo meza deploy monolith --tags smw-data`

    Merge pull request #44 from freephile/REL1_39
    
    Upgrade Meza to MediaWiki REL1_39 and PHP 8.1

commit 1e91f9ed730b7c4c60b8a9d77462dd8b25f0ade9
Author: Greg Rundlett <greg.rundlett@gmail.com>

    Fix permission problems + naming in .smw.json directory
    
    Fixes issue #44 "Ensure .smw.json has a home"
    
    The permission problems stem from the fact that a local userX can run ad-hoc shell scripts that will want to read/write; a deploy will read-write as user meza-ansible and of course the web server process will read-write as apache. So all these users and groups can be handled with meza-ansible:wheel
    
    The directory naming problem stems from the choice to use the wgDBname variable instead of the "wiki id". Wiki ID is a better choice for **wiki** related config data directory; and it's also easier to use over db name because the latter is a composed value, not a simple string.
