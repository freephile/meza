# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" instead of 
# "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."
# 
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.
# 
# - Bullet points are okay, too
# 
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
#   single space, with blank lines in between unless it's a list
# 
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
# like this:

# Resolves: #123
# See also: #456, #789

# https://cbea.ms/git-commit/
# All lines starting with the pound symbol will be discarded
