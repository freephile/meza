# Portmap tcp and udp

#
# Check your firewall setting to open ports 111 for portmap
# requests/replies and Gluster NFS server requests/replies. Gluster NFS
# server operates over the following port numbers: 38465, 38466, and 38467.

# All gluster servers, Gluster Daemon
# maybe also: 24009, 24010, 24011
#
# From the docs

#
# Ensure that TCP and UDP ports 24007 and 24008 are open on all Gluster
# servers. Apart from these ports, you need to open one port for each brick
# starting from port 49152 (instead of 24009 onwards as with previous
# releases). The brick ports assignment scheme is now compliant with IANA
# guidelines. For example: if you have five bricks, you need to have ports
# 49152 to 49156 open.


# One port required for each brick (in meza, this equals each server (one
# brick per server))

# FIXME #801: Some docs said ports 38465, 38466, 38467 needed for Gluster
