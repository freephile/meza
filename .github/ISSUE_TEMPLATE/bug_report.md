## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what went wrong or was unexpected. Please link to any documentation that needs attention. (Documentation is at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Meza or sub-pages.)

## To Reproduce
Tell us exactly how we can see this ourselves. If it can't be reproduced, then does it exist?
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

## Expected behavior
Maybe a bug is not something totally broken, but rather just not working as expected. If you give a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen, then we can try to deliver on expectations. If you experienced an obvious malfunction, then here's your chance to say something clever like "I expected it to work".

## Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. **Please note:** Although "a picture is worth a thousand words", screenshots are a **terrible** substitute for *actual text of error messages*. So, in general, include screenshots if it helps convey the situation - especially visual improvements or abnormalities. Do NOT provide screenshots of text error messages. Give the text instead which makes it easy to search.
